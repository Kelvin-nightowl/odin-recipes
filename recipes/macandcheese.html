    <h2>The best Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <p>This homemade mac and cheese recipe uses a classic mixture of sharp Cheddar and Parmesan. Cheddar is a fantastic base, while Parmesan adds a more complex and salty flavor. Of course, you can adapt this recipe to suit your taste: Gruyere, Monterey Jack, and Gouda are all great options for macaroni and cheese.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>¼ cup salted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
        <li>To make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
